              <h3>It's the foundation for patient- <br>centered primary care.</h3>
              <p>Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across
                clinicians, <br>staff, and patients themselves - making you
                more productive, less stressed, and adding just a bit more joy
                into your practice of medicine.</p>

            never have to leave it. And because Canvas <br>learns from every
